# GroupProject2
Due November 9
In your textbook, Building Java Programs, 5th Edition, on page 1027 (1026 eBook) of Chapter 16 please do Programming Project #3. The four files you need to start with are available under the assignment in Module Chapter 16.

As a group project, the development work must be divided up into parts that can be done by individuals in your group, by group agreement. Your job will be to meet, both in class and on Canvas, via Canvas Mail, to parcel out the work and coordinate your efforts toward completing the project program.

If the group leader currently assigned is not willing to serve, you must choose a team leader by group consensus. This person will have the job of coordinating the efforts of the team members, and assembling the completed project for submission. The output of the project will be a ZIP archive, similar to a homework assignment, that is submitted by the team leader. It must contain all the Java source files needed for the project, and a word document describing the process of completing the project.

Each member of the team will also submit a Word (.docx) document, describing her or his contribution to the project and a characterization of the project process, from his or her perspective. Note that this document must be forwarded to the team leader for inclusion in the ZIP archive that is submitted for the team. That individual must submit the ZIP archive, which must include her or his own descriptive document, as well as those from each of the rest of the team. In short, the only submission for this project will be the one ZIP archive, submitted by the team leader. If you have questions about any of this, please see me.
